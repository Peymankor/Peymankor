# Peyman Kor—@Peymankor

Hi, I am Peyman Kor working on to connect Data Science with real world challenges to make impact. I do belive the ability get sense out of messy Data is a super power that could add significant value to any analytic team. :fire:

## My values
🌟 Expression as authentic self<br>
💖 Safety and trust<br>
🍏 Beginner's mindset and curiosity<br>
🙌 Shared understanding and consensus

## How I work
My motivations are to stabilize and provide clarity through curiosity. That tends to manifest as creating (hopefully) just enough process. Checklists are my absolute favorite. ✅ If I'm too much in my head, feel free to nudge me to share what's in my brain. 😸
